	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p> I am a Lecturer in Veterinary Epidemiology at the University of Surrey. After finishing my Engineering Degree, I moved to the Vet. School at the University of Glasgow for a PhD modelling sheep and nematode interactions. I then joined the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at Princeton University as a postdoctoral research associate, before moving to the Mathematics department at the University of Warwick, where I worked modelling control and elimination interventions for a wide range of diseases. I then started my current position at Surrey, with a focus on informing policy decision-making, enhancing understanding of diagnostics and modelling infectious disease dynamics using machine learning and other statistical tools. Currently, I collaborate with the NTD modelling consortium and I am a member of the NTDhub; I work on a wide range of infectious diseases, from macro-parasites (lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and other helminths) to Viruses (Measles, FMDV), in both humans and animals. </p>
